Based on the Hi3861 platform, the OpenHarmony WLAN module provides abundant peripheral operation capabilities, including the I2C, I2S, ADC, UART, SPI, SDIO, GPIO, PWM, and flash memory. This document describes how to control GPIO pins by calling the OpenHarmony native development kit \(NDK\) interface to implement LED blinking. For details about how to control other IoT peripherals, see the API guide.
