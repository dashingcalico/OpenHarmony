The OpenHarmony security team is responsible for managing security vulnerabilities discovered in OpenHarmony. The OpenHarmony security team conducts security research to discover vulnerabilities and takes measures to handle reported vulnerabilities. If you find security or privacy issues in OpenHarmony, submit a report.

After OpenHarmony security vulnerabilities are fixed, the OpenHarmony security team will notify OpenHarmony partners of details about the vulnerabilities and provide corresponding patches. Partners will release over-the-air \(OTA\) updates for the security vulnerabilities of OpenHarmony devices. The update time varies depending on the device, manufacturer, and carrier.

One month after notifying partners of vulnerabilities, the OpenHarmony security team will place the vulnerabilities in the OpenHarmony community bulletin.
